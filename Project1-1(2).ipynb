    "## Overview\n",
    "### Welcome to an exciting project where we bring images to life through data analysis and clustering! In this journey, we’ll take a vibrant image of a rainbow, transform it into a dataset full of colorful pixel information, and explore the beauty of data by grouping these pixels into clusters. Whether it’s using scikit-learn’s trusty KMeans or diving into custom clustering magic with PyTorch, each task is a step deeper into the art and science of image processing. Let’s paint a picture with pixels, break it down into data, and watch the patterns unfold!"

    "## Task 1: Creating the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "Your mission is to extract valuable data from the `rainbow1.jpg` image. We will transform each pixel into a row of data containing its (x, y) coordinates and RGB color values, creating a comprehensive dataset ready for analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Follow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load the Image**: Use the `PIL` (Pillow) library to open and read the image file. \n",
    "   * *Hint*: Make sure to handle images with an alpha channel (`RGBA`) by converting them to `RGB` to simplify your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Convert to a NumPy Array**: Transform the image into a NumPy array for easy access to pixel data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Extract Coordinates and RGB Values**:\n",
    "   - Create arrays for x and y coordinates using NumPy functions like `np.arange()` and `np.tile()`.\n",
    "   - Reshape the image array to extract the RGB values for each pixel in a format that’s easy to work with.\n",
    "   * *Hint*: The `reshape(-1, 3)` method helps flatten the array while keeping the RGB structure intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Create a Pandas DataFrame**:\n",
    "   - Combine the (x, y) coordinates and RGB values into a structured DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Inspect the DataFrame**:\n",
    "   - Print out the first ten rows of the DataFrame to ensure that the data extraction was successful."

    "\n",
    "### Steps to Follow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Visualize the Original Image**:\n",
    "   - Use `matplotlib` to display the image from the dataset and observe any visible noise or artifacts.\n",
    "2. **Analyze Noise**:\n",
    "   - Look for patterns or outliers in the pixel data that indicate noise (e.g., isolated dark spots or random bright pixels).\n",
    "3. **Filter the Dataset**:\n",
    "   - Use conditions to filter out unwanted noise based on RGB values or other criteria.\n",
    "4. **Reconstruct and Display the Cleaned Image**:\n",
    "   - Reconstruct the image using the filtered DataFrame and visualize it to confirm that the noise has been reduced."

    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "In this task, you'll apply clustering techniques to the image dataset to identify and group pixels with similar properties. The main goal is to learn how clustering can reveal patterns in data and segment the image into distinct regions based on color and position.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Follow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Standardize the Data**:\n",
    "   - Choose an appropriate scaler from `scikit-learn` to standardize the pixel data, ensuring all features contribute equally to the clustering process. You may use any scaler that suits your needs (e.g., `StandardScaler`, `MinMaxScaler`).\n",
    "   - *Hint*: Experimenting with different scalers can help you understand their impact on clustering results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Perform KMeans Clustering**:\n",
    "   - Utilize `KMeans` from `scikit-learn` to cluster the dataset into groups. Select the number of clusters based on your analysis or experimentation.\n",

    "   - Use any plotting library of your choice to create a visualization that shows how the image is segmented into clusters.\n",
